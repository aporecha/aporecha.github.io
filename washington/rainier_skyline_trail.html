<body>

  <p>Ascending to 14,410 feet above sea level, Mount Rainier stands as an icon in the Washington landscape. 
    An active volcano, Mount Rainier is the most glaciated peak in the contiguous U.S.A., spawning five major rivers.</p>

<p><em>1.75 miles RT, 600 feet elevation gain</em></p>

<p>Located on the South Side, this is probably the best hike to take if you have only a day to spend. <br>It starts at the Paradise visitor&#8217;s center and the initial grade (about 0.4 miles) is steep but levels off after that for some magnificent views of the majestic 14410 foot peak.  The total roundtrip is around 5.5 miles but we only did a part of it given we were there for only a couple of hours.  </p>

  <p>It&#8217;s very popular and expect crowds during the busy summer months &#8211; this trail is also used to access the icefield and we saw a long line of trekkers on that heading toward Camp Muir which is located at 10,188 ft. The trail is paved but steep (as you can see in the pic above). It&#8217;s doable for all ages &#8211; just take it slow if you run out of breath. We saw young kids and folks with strollers (though I wouldn&#8217;t recommend a stroller &#8211; a baby carrier would be more appropriate )</p>

<p>Even though the camp looks accessible and can easily be seen on this trail, it&#8217;s a strenous 8-10 hour hike (considered one of the most deadly in America esp due to the changing conditions) to get there and the final couple of miles are always snow-covered &#8211; the weather shifts, avalanches and falling rocks pose a hazard and there have been several fatalities &#8211; </p>

  <p>There are boulders to sit and rest on &#8211; though this one was taken ðŸ™‚ The views along the Skyline trail are amazing, rolling clouds one side, glacier covered mountains on the other &#8211; and if you happen to be here during spring and summer &#8211; flowers everywhere!  </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for my special families </h3>



<ul><li>This is a paved trail so it is kind of strollers and wheelchairs accessible &#8211; though you will need a loved one to help push and control it in area as it is quite steep in areas. </li>
 <li>Carry ample of water and some snacks for the young ones. </li><li>Come early or skip the other stops and come to this point first &#8211; as parking is very limited &#8211; even handicap parking.</li>
  <li>Take breaks and enjoy the scenery. </li><li>Hiking sticks and crampons might be a good add on if you plan to walk on the glacier towards the end of the hike</li><li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Weather changes very quickly in the mountains &#8211; always come well prepared.</mark> </strong>When we drove into the park it was pouring and so foggy we couldn&#8217;t see the road &#8211; in an hours time it was clear and sunny &#8211; when we did the hike it started to get cold and windy &#8211; and when we left the hike it was raining and foggy again. Carry enough water, layered clothes, rain gear, good hiking shoes and hike in good light.  </li></ul>
