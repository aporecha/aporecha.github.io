<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Totem Bright State Park</h2>



<p>Ten miles north of Ketchikan is Totem Bight State Historical Park, an 11-acre park that is packed with restored and re-carved totems as well as a colorful Clan House. Providing a stunning backdrop to the totems is park&#8217;s lush rainforest setting and the rocky coastline along Tongass Narrows.</p>



<p>The Clan House is the central attraction at the park, offering an inside look at Alaska Native culture and history. The stunning structure, with its intricate carvings and vibrant artwork, is an example of living quarters that would have been shared by 30 to 50 family members of the same lineage, led by a house chief. Inside the house is one large room with a central fireplace surrounded by a planked platform.</p>



<p>Visitors can then stroll through the rainforest to view the totems and learn the history of the area through these “silent storytellers,” created to pass down stories from generation to generation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">LANDSCAPE AND WILDLIFE</h3>

<p>Totem Bight State Historical Park is nestled in dense temperate rainforest. The vast majority of Alaska’s coastal temperate rainforests are old growth, consisting primarily of western hemlock, Sitka spruce, mountain hemlock, Alaska yellow cedar and salmon berry bushes. Mature coastal temperate rainforests are extraordinarily complex and stable habitats. Wildlife in the area includes brown bears, black bears, wolves, Sitka black tailed deer, humpback whales, orcas, salmon, bald eagles, and harlequin ducks.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HISTORY</h3>


<p>When many of Alaska&#8217;s indigenous peoples left villages to seek work in the early 1900s, the villages and totem poles they left behind were soon overgrown by forests and eroded by weather. In 1938, the U.S. Forest Service began a program designed to salvage these large cedar monuments by hiring skilled&nbsp;Tlingit and Haida&nbsp;carvers to restore or replicate them.</p>


<p>The project grew into the construction of a model Alaska Native village, and by World War II the Clan Hose was complete and 15 poles were restored. The name of the site was then changed to Totem Bight. When Alaska received statehood in 1959, the title to the land passed from the federal government to the State of Alaska. In 1970, the state park was added to the National Register of Historic Places.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">FACILITIES AND CAMPING</h3>

<p>There is no camping at Totem Bight State Historical Park. Visitor facilities include interpretive displays, a bookshop, and a viewing deck overlooking the Tongass Narrows.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GETTING HERE</h3>

<p>Totem Bight is ten miles northwest of&nbsp;Ketchikan&nbsp;along North Tongass Highway. The Blue Line city bus connects downtown Ketchikan to Totem Bight State Historical Park.</p>

<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Things to consider </span></em></strong></p>

<ul><li><span style="color: initial;">Service is hourly except on Sunday.&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li>Bus fare is<strong>&nbsp;$2</strong>&nbsp;for adults; $1 for youths 12-17; and $.50 for children 11 and younger (who ride free when accompanied by adults). A day pass is $5 for adults and $2.50 for youths 17 and younger.</li>
	<li>A free downtown shuttle bus runs May through September.</li>
	<li>The buses are equipped to accommodate strollers/ wheelchairs, but keep in mind that they do get quite crowded. </li>
	<li>The bus has air conditioning, so if the island is going thru a heat wave, like it was when we visited &#8211; an island tour on the bus felt every bit worth it. </li></ul>

h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bering Sea Crab Fisherman&#8217;s Tour <strong><em><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">*** </mark></em></strong></h2>



<p>An adventure with the Bering Sea Crab Fishermen’s Tour aboard the legendary Aleutian Ballad is not quite the hair-raising death-defying battle with the sea you saw in the series Deadliest Catch. You will meet the same crew and board the same boat, but the boat has been made more comfortable with a heated amphitheater and a panoramic upper deck.</p>
<p>The boat will take you on a comfortable cruise through the calm, protected waters of the Inside Passage around the bays and islands surrounding Ketchikan until you reach the rich fishing grounds. You will watch the crew haul the catch and place some of the animals in a live tank so that you can see them and take photos before they are released unharmed back into the sea. A quick glance at Alaskan long line fishing, king crab and dungeness crab fishing and a good chance to spot some seals, bald eagles and possibly bears. The cruise lasts about three hours.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Martial Tip:- </span></em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Try a sample portion of the king crab legs (without breaking the bank) during your tour of the Bering Sea Crab Fisherman&#8217;s Tour</li>
	<li>Get your DSLR&#8217;s/camera &#8211; the crew usually stops at this great spot to view tons of bald eagles.</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Alaska Fish House <strong><em><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">*** </mark></em></strong></h2>
<p>Located a few mins walk from the cruise dock, right next to the Lumberjack Show in Ketchikan, this place is a summertime hot spot where lines out the door are not an uncommon sight. Killer fish &amp; chips, awesome fish tacos, king crab and the local favorite dungeness crab legs are all the rage here. </p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Martial </span>Tip: </em></strong>Try a sample portion of the king crab legs (without breaking the bank) during your tour of the Bering Sea Crab Fisherman&#8217;s Tour or pick up a decent portion at wholesale price from one of Costco locations in Anchorage.</p>
